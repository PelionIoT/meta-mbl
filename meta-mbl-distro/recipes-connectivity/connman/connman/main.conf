#For now, no configuration is taking place, all entries are commented. This is Kept for possible future use.
#You must uncomment start of section (the only current suction is 'General'), which starts with '###'.
#You may uncomment any parameter you wish to config, which starts with '##'

#Set input request timeout. Default is 120 seconds The request for inputs like passphrase will timeout after certain amount of time.
#Use this setting to increase the value in case of different user interface designs.
##InputRequestTimeout=secs

#Set browser launch timeout. Default is 300 seconds The request for launching a browser for portal pages will timeout after certain amount of time.
#Use this setting to increase the value in case of different user interface designs.
##BrowserLaunchTimeout=secs

#Enable background scanning. Default is true. Background scanning will start every 5 minutes unless the scan list is empty.
#In that case, a simple backoff mechanism starting from 10s up to 5 minutes will run.
##BackgroundScanning=true | false

#List of Fallback timeservers separated by ",". These timeservers are used for NTP sync when there are no
#timeserver set by the user or by the service. These can contain mixed combination of fully qualified domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
##FallbackTimeservers=server[,...]

#List of fallback nameservers separated by "," appended to the list of nameservers given by the service.
#The nameserver entries must be in numeric format, host names are ignored.
##FallbackNameservers=server[,...]

#List of technologies that are marked autoconnectable by default, separated by commas ",".
#The default value for this entry when empty is ethernet,wifi,cellular. Services that are automatically connected must have
#been set up and saved to storage beforehand.
##DefaultAutoConnectTechnologies=technology[,...]

#List of technoolgies which are always connected regardless of PreferredTechnologies setting (AutoConnect = true).
#The default value is empty and this feature is disabled unless explicitely enabled in the config file.
##AlwaysConnectedTechnologies=technology[,...]

#List of preferred technologies from the most preferred one to the least preferred one separated by commas ",".
#Services of the listed technology type will be tried one by one in the order given, until one of them gets connected or they are all tried.
#A service of a preferred technology type in state 'ready' will get the default route when compared to another preferred type
#further down the list with state 'ready' or with a non-preferred type; a service of a preferred technology type in state 'online'
#will get the default route when compared to either a non-preferred type or a preferred type further down in the list.
PreferredTechnologies=ethernet,wifi

#List of blacklisted network interfaces separated by ",". Found interfaces will be compared to the list and will not be handled by connman,
#if their first characters match any of the list entries. Default value is vmnet,vboxnet,virbr,ifb.
#NetworkInterfaceBlacklist=

#Allow connman to change the system hostname. This can happen for example if we receive DHCP hostname option. Default value is true.
##AllowHostnameUpdates=true | false

#Keep only a single connected technology at any time. When a new service is connected by the user or a better one is found
#according to PreferredTechnologies, the new service is kept connected and all the other previously connected services are
#disconnected. With this setting it does not matter whether the previously connected services are in 'online' or 'ready' states,
#the newly connected service is the only one that will be kept connected. A service connected by the user will be used until
#going out of network coverage. With this setting enabled applications will notice more network breaks than normal. Default value is false.
##SingleConnectedTechnology=true | false

#List of technologies that are allowed to enable tethering separated by ",". The default value is wifi,bluetooth,gadget.
#Only those technologies listed here are used for tethering. If one wants to tether ethernet, then add "ethernet" in the list.
#NOTE that if ethernet tethering is enabled, then a DHCP server is started on all ethernet interfaces.
#Tethered ethernet should never be connected to corporate or home network as it will disrupt normal operation of these networks.
#Due to this ethernet is not tethered by default. Do not activate ethernet tethering unless you really know what you are doing.
##TetheringTechnologies=technology[,...]

#Restore earlier tethering status when returning from offline mode, re-enabling a technology, and after restarts and reboots.
#Default value is false.
##PersistentTetheringMode=true | false

#Automatically enable Anycast 6to4 if possible. This is not recommended, as the use of 6to4 will generally
#lead to a severe degradation of connection quality. See RFC6343.  Default value is false (as recommended by RFC6343 section 4.1).
##Enable6to4=true | false

#Set DHCP option 60 (Vendor Class ID) to the given string. This option can be used by DHCP servers to identify specific
#clients without having to rely on MAC address ranges, etc
##VendorClassID=string

#Enable or disable use of HTTP GET as an online status check. When a service is in a READY state, and is selected as default,
#ConnMan will issue an HTTP GET request to verify that end-to-end connectivity is successful.
#Only then the service will be transitioned to ONLINE state. If this setting is false,
#the default service will remain in READY state. Default value is true.
##EnableOnlineCheck=true | false
